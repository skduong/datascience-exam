    "To get some idea of what these features are and their relationship, I would start by looking at their distributions and correlations, taking note of any patterns or outliers that may appear since it could affect which models are more effective. For instance, if high multicolinearity is present, logistic regression would probably not be an ideal choice (or if chosen, would require further analysis such using VIF). \n",
    "To get a \"good\" subset of features, selecting features that have a high Pearson Correlation coefficient against the response would be a possible choice. Seeing that the size of p is rather extreme, this simple solution may not suffice (for instance, it may be the case that thousands of features end up having r<-0.8 or r>0.8). Rather than just removing features, dimension reduction through PCA may also be considered. Through this method, the features are compressed through their linear combinations, resulting in less redundancy while still explaining a high proportion of the data variance. Since this is a classification task, I would also look at the class balance and possibly rebalance through SMOTE if necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "With only N=100, the data is insufficient for machine learning models such as MLPs and would lead to poor generalization. Even with less complex models like random forest, overfitting may still be a problem with so little cases and possibly high number of features to train on. Simpler classifiers may be the best choice in this case, so I would try KNN, SVM, and Logistic Regression and compare their results to determine the best one. \n",
    "For a concrete example, suppose KNN is chosen. The data will be rescaled if needed and then randomly split into 20% test and 80% training sets. To determine the parameter of how many neighbors to consider, K, I would start by testing a wide range of values, like between 1 and 50, and comparing performance on the training and test sets with a simple plot. From there, I would close onto the best K value based on where error and overfit (the difference in train and test performance) is low. To better generalize the model, k-fold cross validation can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple resampling of the test/train set can be used to assess the model. Ideally, the results should not show high fluctuation in performance when trying different sets. Given that the classes are balanced, a confusion matrix can be used to see overall accuracies and reveal any specific classes that the model has trouble identifying. If false positives are a concern, precision, recall and F1 scores can also be considered."
